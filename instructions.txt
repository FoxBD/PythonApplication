# Flask MSSQL CRUD App Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Install dependencies
You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_migrate pyodbc sqlalchemy
```

## Step 2: Set up the database connection
Ensure you have the following connection string in your `app/__init__.py` file:

```python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = "mssql+pyodbc:///?odbc_connect=DRIVER%3D%7BODBC%20Driver%2017%20for%20SQL%20Server%7D%3BSERVER%3DLAPTOP-FOXBD%3BDATABASE%3DVerySecureDatabase%3BTrusted_Connection%3Dyes%3BTrustServerCertificate%3Dyes"
```

Make sure to adjust the connection string according to your SQL Server setup.

## Step 3: Run the migrations
To set up the database tables, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

This will create the tables and apply any migrations.

## Step 4: Running the application
Once the migrations are done, start the Flask application:

```bash
python run.py
```

The app will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can now interact with the API.
